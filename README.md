## DEMO & Instructions & QuickStart

The UI is bit different with the v1. The following video is still appropriate. icns Creator is a macOS application that allows you to easily create icns files from any PNG or JPG image file. With this tool, you can quickly generate high-quality icns files to use as icons for your macOS applications or generate a single appropriate .iconset file.
