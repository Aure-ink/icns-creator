## DEMO & Instructions & QuickStart

The UI is a lot different with the v1. The following video is still appropriate. icns Creator is a macOS application that allows you to easily create icns files from any PNG or JPG image file. With this tool, you can quickly generate high-quality icns files to use as icons for your macOS applications or generate a single appropriate .iconset file. Codesigning is an headache for me! And I do not want to pay for an app that I release as open-source. You can review the code, if you have concerns about the app. Or simply, you can choose not to use the app üññüèª.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Support for PNG and JPG image formats
- Automatic generation of icns files in variable sizes
- iconset folder and individual .icns file generation
- Options to set icon style for Apple design standarts

## Installation

To use icns Creator, follow these steps:

1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/alptugan/icns-creator/releases) page. If you want to edit the source code, clone the repository to your local machine & open it with XCode.  
2. Open the icns Creator application file (`icns-creator.app`).
3. If prompted, allow the application to run on your system.
4. You're ready to start creating icns files out of PNG, JPG, or any other image document!

## Usage for Designers & Developers

1. Prepare your image file in your preferred image editor, ensuring it has a minimum size of 1024x1024 pixels.
2. Save the image file as a PNG or JPG file in a 1:1 aspect ratio for the best results.
3. Open the icns Creator application.
4. Click the `Browse` button or drag & drop the image.
5. `.iconset` tab creates a single icon file, or `.icns` tab creates individual .icns files required for html pages.
6. By default shadow, rounded corners and padding for the generated icon is enabled. For recent Mac OS standards, you should enable all of the options to apply Apple Design standarts. If you just want to generate .icns files as before, disable all of the options.
7. The files will be created in the same directory as the original image file.
